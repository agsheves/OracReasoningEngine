This reasoning engine is designed to help solve problems where there might be insufficient data to train an LLC so instead, a series of rules or heuristics are provided to the LLC to act as subject matter guidance. 

Despite their power, Large Language Models struggle with specialized expert tasks where there is little or no trainable data. But what if we could teach them like we teach management consultants - using expert-created rules of thumb? This approach harnesses the LLM's general reasoning abilities but provides domain-specific guidance to provide high-quality results. Positive early tests applying this appsoach to corporate negotiations and geopolitical challenges show this practical approach could unlock AI's potential in these high-value domains.
