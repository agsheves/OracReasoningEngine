## The Orac Reasoning Agent: LLM-based decision-making where there is little training data

This reasoning engine is designed to help solve problems where there might be insufficient data to train an LLC, so instead, a series of rules or heuristics are provided to the LLM to act as subject matter guidance.

Despite their power, Large Language Models struggle with specialized expert tasks where there is little or no trainable data. But what if we could teach them like we teach management consultants - using expert-created rules of thumb? This approach harnesses the LLM's general reasoning abilities but provides domain-specific guidance to provide high-quality results. Positive early tests applying this approach to corporate negotiations and geopolitical challenges show that this practical approach could unlock AI's potential in these high-value domains.

### This is an open-source project

This software would not have been possible without the generosity of many in the security risk management and AI communities so, to maintain that spirit of openness, the code is being released under the GNU Affero General Public License. This is in the hope that many people will be able to benefit from this approach to decision-making and encourage others in the Security Risk Management space to take an equally collaborative approach.
